Originating internally in 2002 at Amazon.com, AWS became publicly available in 2003, marking the inception of cloud services. The journey continued with the launch of the Simple Queue Service (SQS) in 2004, followed by SQS, EC2, and S3 two years later. Expanding its reach globally, AWS established its first European data center in 2007. Today, AWS stands as a global platform trusted by millions, including renowned entities like Netflix, Airbnb, and NASA.
